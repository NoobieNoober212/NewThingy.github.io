        <p>According to CNN, the ICE(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) held "an average of more than 42,000 people in custody each day throughout fiscal year 2018." Apparently,the previous record high since the ICE started tracking data, was in 2017 when just over 38,000 people were detained. </p>
        <p>CNN also states "Over the past year, the monthly average numbers fluctuated between a low of 39,192 last October and a high of 44,699 in June." Immigration and Customs Enforcement  was not formally created until 2003 but provided data from dententions back from 2001 when the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service(INS) would handle detentions. In 2003 INS was disbanded and ICE was created.</p>
